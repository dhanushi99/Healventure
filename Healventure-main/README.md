git clone [path copied from remote] 

git fetch -> is to get all the branches from remote to local

git pull origin dev -> most recommended

git checkout [branch name] -> switch to that particular branch to work on
    Optional:
      git stash -> is used to save temporarily in our local
      git checkout [branch name]
      git stash pop -> this will retrieve the changes which are temporarily saved

Either use UI in android studio to commit or else use:
  git add [path] or else .
  git commit -m "some message"
  
git pull origin dev
git push origin dev
